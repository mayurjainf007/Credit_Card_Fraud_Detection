Real-Time Fraud Detection System
Description: Developed a scalable, real-time fraud detection system leveraging big data technologies, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure to analyze high-frequency transaction data.

Key Technologies: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS (EMR, S3, EC2, Lambda, Cognito), Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, TensorFlow, Flask, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack

Responsibilities and Achievements:

Designed and implemented a distributed fraud detection pipeline using Kafka for real-time data streaming and Spark for low-latency processing, achieving 95% detection accuracy.
Integrated deep learning models (Transformers, autoencoders) for dynamic fraud detection, handling evolving fraud patterns and reducing false positives.
Enhanced system reliability and scalability by deploying on AWS with S3 for data storage, EMR for distributed processing, and EC2 for hosting the backend API.
Containerized the application with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, achieving efficient resource management and streamlined deployment.
Set up real-time monitoring and centralized logging using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack, enabling proactive issue resolution and performance optimization.
Built a responsive dashboard for transaction monitoring and visualization, implementing secure access control with AWS Cognito.
Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub Actions to streamline development, testing, and deployment processes, enhancing project efficiency.
